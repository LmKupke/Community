Project Description
Healthcare is one of the most critical factors in the United States. It raises many concerns for the citizens and internationals in America. In 2019 alone, it was a struggle to implement strategies to track the growth of medical and pharmaceutical costs and impacts to access the quality of care. People tend to be careless, of which healthcare plans bring the most benefits to themselves or their households since there are always limited choices, which usually based on their company's options. There are limited resources in terms of web/mobile applications to aid a customer in choosing the most optimal and suitable plan based on his or her condition. We seek to help people to understand by addressing and assuring that people's interactions and outcomes are easy, convenient, and timely so that their chosen plans on our web/mobile fit naturally of their lifestyle.

The goal of this project is to create a robust website that is compatible with mobile devices, which will allow any user in the United States and Internationals to purchase premium health care packages from US-based healthcare insurance provider. We plan to partner with Insurance agents across states, get approval on annual rates, and match our clients with three tiers of health care packages alongside varying rates for each package tailoring to their profile information. In the health insurance packages section, we will provide the best information about health care access, including access medical and pharmaceutical needs,  in the zip code, and provide health insurance purchase options. People will use our product because we will provide fast, reliable, annual health plan plans given their profile. Because we are partnered with accredited insurance agents, they will sign up with us. In this way, people will save time setting up an appointment with agents and would receive a personalized plan based on their profile.
