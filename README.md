# HealthInsuranceApp
## Introduction

The goal of this project is to create a robust web/mobile application that will allow any user in the United States and Internationals to purchase premium health care packages from US based healthcare insurance provider applicable inside United States. We plan to partner with Insurance agent in all states, get approval on annual rates and match our clients with three tiers of health care packages alongside varying rate for each package given their profile. If time allows, we plan to develop additional machine learning algorithm that predict rates depending on the parameters set on customer profile. For example: a healthy user might have lower insurance rates compared to unhealthy ones. In the health insurance packages section, we will provide the best information about health care access in the zip code, and provide health insurance purchase options. People will use our application specially because healthcare is an immediate need and if people notices we are partnered or accredited, they will sign up with us fast instead of scheduling in person appointment with other agents.
