# HealthInsuranceApp
## Introduction

Project Description
Healthcare is one of the most important factors in the United States. It raises many concerns for the citizens including the internationals in America. In 2019 alone, it is a struggle to implement strategies to track the growth of medical and pharmaceutical costs and impacts to access quality of care. People tend to be careless of which healthcare plans bring the most benefits to themselves or their households, since there are always limited choices, which usually based on their company’s options. There are restricted resources web/mobile application to aid a customer to choose the most optimal and suitable plan based on his or her personal condition. We seek to help people to understand by addressing and assuring that people interactions and outcomes are easy, convenient and timely so that their chosen plans on our web/mobile fit naturally of their lifestyle, households and daily activities. 

The goal of this project is to create a robust web/mobile application that will allow any user in the United States and Internationals to purchase premium health care packages from US based healthcare insurance provider applicable inside United States. We plan to partner with Insurance agent in all states, get approval on annual rates and match our clients with three tiers of health care packages alongside varying rate for each package tailoring to their profile information. If time allows, we plan to develop additional machine learning algorithm that predict rates depending on the parameters set on customer profile. For example: a healthy user might have lower insurance rates compared to unhealthy ones. In the health insurance packages section, we will provide the best information about health care access in the zip code, and provide health insurance purchase options. People will use our application specially because healthcare is an immediate need and if people notices we are partnered or accredited, they will sign up with us fast instead of scheduling in person appointment with other agents.
